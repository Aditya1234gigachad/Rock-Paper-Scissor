# About my first project on Github.
Hello guys, today I just uploaded my first project on Github.It is a simple game named Rock Paper Scissor.You have to enter any character form r,s,p (note that, r means rocks, p means paper, s means scissor) and your system will also generate a random character from r,s,p.
Here are some rules:-
  1. If you entered r and system entered s, you win.
  2. If you entered r and system entered p, system win.
  3. If you entered p and system entered s, system win.
  4. If you entered p and system entered r, you win.
  5. If you entered s and system entered r, system win.
  6. If you entered s and system entered p, you win.
  7. If you and the system entered the same character, then it's a tie.
 So now you can enjoy this game on your free time.
